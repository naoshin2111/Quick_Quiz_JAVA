# Quick_Quiz_JAVA
A Java-based quiz tool that enables users to make and take quizzes is the project. Users can choose to begin the quiz or add more questions using the program's two major options.

The "Add Quiz" option allows the user to add a question with multiple answers and specify the right answer. With the help of the Gson Java package, the quiz set is saved as a JSON file, making data manipulation and reading simple.

The quiz will display with a question and many choice answers if the user chooses the "Start Quiz" option. The user has to choose the right response from the list of possibilities. The system will display the final score after the quiz is finished.
